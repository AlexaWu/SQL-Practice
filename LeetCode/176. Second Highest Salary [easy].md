# [176. Second Highest Salary [easy]](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

Id | Salary
-- | ----
1  | 100
2  | 200
3  | 300

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

SecondHighestSalary
--|
200           

#### SQL Schema
```javascript
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300')
```

## Approach I: Using sub-query and _LIMIT_ clause [Accepted]
#### Algorithm

Sort the distinct salary in descend order and then utilize the _LIMIT_ clause to get the second highest salary.

```javascript
SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
```

However, this solution will be judged as 'Wrong Answer' if there is no such second highest salary since there might be only one record in this table. To overcome this issue, we can take this as a temp table.

#### MySQL
```javascript
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
```
## Approach II: Using _IFNULL_ and _LIMIT_ clause [Accepted]
Another way to solve the 'NULL' problem is to use _IFNULL_ funtion as below.

#### MySQL
```javascript
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
       LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
#### Output
> {"headers": ["SecondHighestSalary"], "values": [[200]]}
