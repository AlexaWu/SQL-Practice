# [196.	Delete Duplicate Emails [easy]](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/)

Write a SQL query to **delete** all duplicate email entries in a table named `Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its **smallest Id**.

 Id | Email            
--|--
 1  | john@example.com 
 2  | bob@example.com  
 3  | john@example.com 

>Id is the primary key column for this table.

For example, after running your query, the above `Person` table should have the following rows:

 Id | Email            
--|--
 1  | john@example.com 
 2  | bob@example.com  

>Note: Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use **delete** statement.

#### SQL Schema
```javascript
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('1', 'john@example.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('2', 'bob@example.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('3', 'john@example.com')
```

## Approach: Using _DELETE_ and _WHERE_ clause [Accepted]
#### Algorithm

By joining this table with itself on the Email column, we can get the following code.
```javascript
SELECT p1.*
FROM Person p1,
     Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email
;
```
Then we need to find the bigger id having same email address with other records. So we can add a new condition to the WHERE clause like this.
```javascript
SELECT p1.*
FROM Person p1,
     Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email 
AND p1.Id > p2.Id
;
```
As we already get the records to be deleted, we can alter this statement to **DELETE** in the end.

#### MySQL
```javascript
DELETE p1 
FROM Person p1,
     Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email 
AND p1.Id > p2.Id
```
#### Output
>{"headers": ["Id", "Email"], "values": [[1, "john@example.com"], [2, "bob@example.com"]]}
