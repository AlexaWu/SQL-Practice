# 550. Game Play Analysis IV [medium]

Table: `Activity`

Column Name  | Type    
--|--
 player_id    | int     
 device_id    | int     
 event_date   | date    
 games_played | int     

(_player_id, event_date_) is the primary key of this table.\
This table shows the activity of players of some game.\
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the **fraction** of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, **rounded to 2 decimal places**. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.
求出首次登陆游戏后第二天又登陆游戏的玩家所占的比例，保留两位小数；

The query result format is in the following example:

`Activity` table:
 player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played 
--|--|--|--
 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            
 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            
 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            
 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            
 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            

`Result` table:
fraction  |
--|
0.33      |

Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

#### SQL Schema

```javascript
Create table If Not Exists Activity (player_id int, device_id int, event_date date, games_played int)
Truncate table Activity
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-01', '5')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-02', '6')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('2', '3', '2017-06-25', '1')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '1', '2016-03-02', '0')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '4', '2018-07-03', '5')
```

## Approach I: 先过滤出每个用户的首次登陆日期，然后左关联，筛选次日存在的记录的比例
```javascript
select round(avg(a.event_date is not null), 2) fraction
from 
    (select player_id, min(event_date) as login
    from activity
    group by player_id) p 
left join activity a 
on p.player_id=a.player_id and datediff(a.event_date, p.login)=1
```   

## Approach II: 求出所有玩家首次登陆数据，将其作为临时表，并和所有数据表activity比较找日期相差1天的玩家
```javascript
select round(sum(case when datediff(a.event_date,b.first_date)=1 then 1 else 0 end)/(select count(distinct(player_id)) 
    from activity),2) as fraction
from activity a,
    (select player_id, min(event_date) first_date 
    from activity 
group by player_id) b
where a.player_id=b.player_id

求出所有玩家首次登陆数据
select player_id,min(event_date) first_date from activity group by player_id

将所有玩家首次登陆数据作为临时表，并和所有数据表activity进行关联
select *
from activity a,
(select player_id,min(event_date) first_date from activity group by player_id) b
where a.player_id=b.player_id

使用datediff函数计算玩家每次登陆和首次登陆的日期差，使用count+distinct函数获取所有玩家数
select datediff(a.event_date,b.first_date),(select count(distinct(player_id)) from activity)
from activity a,
(select player_id,min(event_date) first_date from activity group by player_id) b
where a.player_id=b.player_id

使用case when then else过滤出所有符合条件的玩家，然后使用sum求和，计算出符合条件的玩家数目
select sum(case when datediff(a.event_date,b.first_date)=1 then 1 else 0 end),(select count(distinct(player_id)) from activity)
from activity a,
(select player_id,min(event_date) first_date from activity group by player_id) b
where a.player_id=b.player_id

最后将符合条件的玩家数除以所有玩家数，并使用round函数，保留两位小数,并且按照例子上面的输出结果给列名取个别名即可
select round(sum(case when datediff(a.event_date,b.first_date)=1 then 1 else 0 end)/(select count(distinct(player_id)) from activity),2) as fraction
from activity a,
(select player_id,min(event_date) first_date from activity group by player_id) b
where a.player_id=b.player_id
```
