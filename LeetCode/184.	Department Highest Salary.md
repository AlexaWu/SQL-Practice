# [184.	Department Highest Salary [medium]](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-highest-salary/)

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

 Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId 
--|--|--|--
 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            
 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            
 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            
 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            
 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

 Id | Name     
--|--
| 1  | IT       
| 2  | Sales    

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

 Department | Employee | Salary 
--|--|--
 IT         | Max      | 90000  
 IT         | Jim      | 90000  
 Sales      | Henry    | 80000  


> Explanation:
Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

#### SQL Schema
```javascript
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, DepartmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('2', 'Jim', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('3', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('4', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('5', 'Max', '90000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Sales')
```

## Approach: Using _JOIN_ and _IN_ clause [Accepted]
#### Algorithm
Since the `Employee` table contains the Salary and DepartmentId information, we can query the highest salary in a department.
```javascript
SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY DepartmentId;
```
> Note: There might be multiple employees having the same highest salary, so it is safe not to include the employee name information in this query.

 DepartmentId | MAX(Salary) 
--|--
 1            | 90000       
 2            | 80000       
 
 Then, we can join table `Employee` and `Department`, and query the (DepartmentId, Salary) are in the temp table using IN statement as below.
 
 #### MySQL
```javascript
SELECT
    Department.name AS 'Department',
    Employee.name AS 'Employee',
    Salary
FROM Employee
JOIN Department 
ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
WHERE
    (Employee.DepartmentId , Salary) IN
    (   SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY DepartmentId
	)
;
```
 Department | Employee | Salary 
--|--|--
 Sales      | Henry    | 80000  
 IT         | Max      | 90000  
 
 #### Output
> {"headers": ["Department", "Employee", "Salary"], "values": [["IT", "Jim", 90000], ["Sales", "Henry", 80000], ["IT", "Max", 90000]]}
