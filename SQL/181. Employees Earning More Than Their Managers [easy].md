# 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers [easy]
The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId
--|--|---|--
 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         
 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         
 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      
 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
Employee |
--|
Joe      

#### SQL Schema
```javascript
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, ManagerId int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '3')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '4')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', 'None')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', 'None')
```

## Approach I: Using _WHERE_ clause [Accepted]
#### Algorithm
As this table has the employee's manager information, we probably need to select information from it twice.
```javascript
SELECT *
FROM Employee AS a, Employee AS b
;
As this table has the employee's manager information, we probably need to select information from it twice.
```

> The first 3 columns are from a and the last 3 ones are from b.

Select from two tables will get the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of these two tables. In this case, the output will be 4 * 4 = 16 records. However, what we interest is the employee's salary higher than his/her manager. So we should add two conditions in a _WHERE_ clause like below.

```javascript
SELECT
    *
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
```
Id	|Name	|Salary	|ManagerId	|Id	|Name	|Salary	ManagerId
--|--|--|--|--|--|--
1	|Joe	|70000	|3	|3	|Sam	|60000

As we only need to output the employee's name, so we modify the above code a little to get a solution.

#### MySQL
```javascript
SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
```
## Approach II: Using _JOIN_ clause [Accepted]
#### Algorithm

Actually, _JOIN_ is a more common and efficient way to link tables together, and we can use _ON_ to specify some conditions.
```javascript
SELECT
     a.NAME AS Employee
FROM Employee AS a JOIN Employee AS b
     ON a.ManagerId = b.Id
     AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
```
