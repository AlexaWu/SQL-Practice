# 182. Duplicate Emails [easy]
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named `Person`.

Id | Email   
--|--
 1  | a@b.com 
 2  | c@d.com 
 3  | a@b.com 

For example, your query should return the following for the above table:
Email   
--|
a@b.com 

> Note: All emails are in lowercase.
#### SQL Schema
```javascript
Create table If Not Exists Person (Id int, Email varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('1', 'a@b.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('2', 'c@d.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('3', 'a@b.com')
```

## Approach I: Using _GROUP BY_ and a temporary table [Accepted]
#### Algorithm

Duplicated emails existed more than one time. To count the times each email exists, we can use the following code.

```javascript
select Email, count(Email) as num
from Person
group by Email;
```

Email   | num 
---|--
a@b.com | 2   
c@d.com | 1   

Taking this as a temporary table, we can get a solution as below.

```javascript
select Email from
(
  select Email, count(Email) as num
  from Person
  group by Email
) as statistic
where num > 1
;
```
## Approach II: Using _GROUP BY_ and _HAVING_ condition [Accepted]

A more common used way to add a condition to a _GROUP BY_ is to use the _HAVING_ clause, which is much simpler and more efficient.

#### MySQL
```javascript
select Email
from Person
group by Email
having count(Email) > 1;
```
