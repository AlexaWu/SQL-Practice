# 185.	Department Top Three Salaries [hard]

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId
--|--|--|--
1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            
2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            
3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            
4  | Max   | 90000  | 1           
5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            
6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            
7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

Id | Name     
--|--
 1  | IT       
 2  | Sales    

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

Department | Employee | Salary 
--|--|--
 IT         | Max      | 90000  
 IT         | Randy    | 85000  
 IT         | Joe      | 85000  
 IT         | Will     | 70000  
 Sales      | Henry    | 80000  
 Sales      | Sam      | 60000  

#### Explanation

In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, and Will earns the third highest salary. There are only two employees in the Sales department, Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.

#### SQL Schema
```javascript
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, DepartmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('5', 'Janet', '69000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('6', 'Randy', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('7', 'Will', '70000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Sales')
```

## Approach: Using _JOIN_ and sub-query [Accepted]

#### Algorithm

A top 3 salary in this company means there is no more than 3 salary bigger than itself in the company.
```javascript
select e1.Name as 'Employee', e1.Salary
from Employee e1
where 3 >
(
    select count(distinct e2.Salary)
    from Employee e2
    where e2.Salary > e1.Salary
)
;
```
In this code, we count the salary number of which is bigger than e1.Salary. So the output is as below for the sample data.

Employee | Salary 
--|--
 Henry    | 80000  
 Max      | 90000  
 Randy    | 85000  
 
Then, we need to join the `Employee` table with `Department` in order to retrieve the department information.

#### MySQL
```javascript
SELECT
    d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary
FROM
    Employee e1
        JOIN
    Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    3 > (SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
        FROM
            Employee e2
        WHERE
            e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
        )
;
```
 Department | Employee | Salary 
--|--|--
 IT         | Joe      | 70000  
 Sales      | Henry    | 80000  
 Sales      | Sam      | 60000  
 IT         | Max      | 90000  
 IT         | Randy    | 85000  

#### Output
> {"headers": ["Department", "Employee", "Salary"], "values": [["IT", "Joe", 85000], ["Sales", "Henry", 80000], ["Sales", "Sam", 60000], ["IT", "Max", 90000], ["IT", "Randy", 85000], ["IT", "Will", 70000]]}
