# 177. Nth Highest Salary [medium]

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the `Employee` table.

Id | Salary |
-- | --
1  | 100  
2  | 200   
3  | 300   

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

getNthHighestSalary(2)
-- |
200

---
## Approach I: only suitable for querying the entire table, cannot querying each group, and cannot process distinct, faster
```javascript
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  DECLARE M INT;
  SET M=N-1;
  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT M, 1
  );
END
```

## Approach II: The N-ranked(distinct) salary means that there are N-1(distinct) salaries higher than it, slow
```javascript
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      SELECT max(e1.Salary)
      FROM employee e1
      WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) 
             FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee) e2 
             WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary) = N - 1
  );
END
```

## Approach III: similar to Approach II, slow but faster than II
```javascript
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      SELECT e1.salary
      FROM employee e1 
      JOIN employee e2 ON e1.salary <= e2.salary
      GROUP BY e1.salary
      HAVING count(DISTINCT e2.salary) = N
  );
END
```

#### Output
> {"headers": ["getNthHighestSalary(2)"], "values": [[200]]}
